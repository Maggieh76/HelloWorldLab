# HelloWorldLab 

## App Description

This Hello World App uses the Kotlin language to create a simple android user input app that uses OnClick listeners.
The app features a textfield that starts by saying "Hello World!", a text input field that features back text to "enter a name", and a clickable button

Following the prompt of "Enter your name", the user inputs their name and then hits the button. 
Upon completion of these two actions, the text in the main field is replaced with "Hi," followed by the name the user inputted.
